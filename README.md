# Home Credit Indonesia Data Scientist Virtual Internship Program
Home Credit Indonesia is a finance company that provides financing services for client (loan). We will create a machine learning model using Home Credit Indonesia dataset, you can check the dataset [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ZrPTlarxaJJo4w0hhyxlYi5UrrCIs9n0?usp=sharing). We will make sure the client who can fulfill the payment are not rejected when applying for loan.
Since the label target is:

 - 1 for client with payment difficulties

 - 0 for client without payment difficulties

We can decide that our objective is create a machine learning model with the least false positive and implemented it to another dataset, false positive and true positive will be the metrics for this case.
